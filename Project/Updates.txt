- Local repository created for project 
- Detailed study of already available program code is in progress.
- Tried running the project with some images of MNIST dataset of 0,1 and 2.
- Facing issue of exception (System.InvalidOperationException) for variable 'tempStat'. 
- CUrrently analysing it and studying abount HTM.
- Conducted Experiment with 7,8 and 9
- Parameters analysis and image proportation analyis with different colors study is in progress.
- Changed the Parameters of JSON file for experiment 4, following parameters were changed:-
"LocalAreaDensity": 0.1 Changed to "LocalAreaDensity": 0.5
"InputDimensions": [
    100,
    100
  ],

to
"InputDimensions": [
    28,
    28
  ],
- Output result gives the more efficient values of comparision with min,max and average value of dataset 3,4 &5
  after the local area density and input dimensions are changed.
