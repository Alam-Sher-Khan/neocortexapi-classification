- Local repository created for project. 
- Detailed study of already available program code is in progress.
- Tried running the project with some images of MNIST dataset.
- Facing issue of exception (System.InvalidOperationException) for variable 'tempStat'. 
- Currently analysing it and studying abount HTM.
- Conducting Experiments with different datasets.
- Parameters analysis and image proportation analyis with different parameters is in progress.
- Changed the Parameters of HTM file for experiment.
- Following Parameters were changed:-
    1. Global/Local Inhibition, 
    2. Potential Radius, 
    3. Local Area Density and 
    4. NumofActiveColumnsPerInArea. 
- Progress to find the best fit correlation between the images of MNIST dataset is in progress.
- Till now we have conducted several experiments and have been able to find the close best fit correlation in between the images of the dataset.
- We are working on the prediction code, which is basically used after learning code, prediction result can find the relation of percentage in dataset.
- Started with the documentation of the project.
- Collecting data, and information in order to document the result.
- Plotting graph and finding the value relation between input and output correlation is in progress.
- After removing the color threshold and keeping the InputDimensions Parameter in htmconfig json file as 28x28, efficient result is obtained.


-Latest Progress
1) We have been able to find the parameters at which the correlation matrix is best.
2) Prediction code is completed and it is able to predict the right label.
3) Input Similarity is obtained correctly.
4) Documentation of the project is in progess and results are recorded.
