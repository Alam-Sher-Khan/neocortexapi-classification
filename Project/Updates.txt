- Local repository created for project. 
- Detailed study of already available program code is in progress.
- Tried running the project with some images of MNIST dataset.
- Facing issue of exception (System.InvalidOperationException) for variable 'tempStat'. 
- Currently analysing it and studying abount HTM.
- Conducting Experiments with different datasets.
- Parameters analysis and image proportation analyis with different parameters is in progress.
- Changed the Parameters of HTM file for experiment.
- Following Parameters were changed:-
    1. Global/Local Inhibition, 
    2. Potential Radius, 
    3. Local Area Density and 
    4. NumofActiveColumnsPerInArea. 
- Progress to find the best fit correlation between the images of MNIST dataset is in progress.
- Till now we have conducted several experiments and have been able to find the close best fit correlation in between the images of the dataset.
- We are working on the prediction code, which is basically used after learning code, prediction result can find the relation of percentage in dataset.
- Started with the documentation of the project.
- Collecting data, and information in order to document the result.
- Plotting graph and finding the value relation between input and output correlation is in progress.
